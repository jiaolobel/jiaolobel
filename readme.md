My name is Jiao Lobel. My research interests include machine learning and computer vision. 

Efficient boundary-aware segmentation for high-resolution images
----------------------------------------------------------------
- In this research, we focus on the efficiency and boundary-awareness for objects of interest in high-resolution images. 
- Multiple solutions, built on approximate algorithms, GPU deployment, and multi-thread implementations for CRF inference, have been tried and give rise to significant boundary-awareness and efficiency gain.
- This has been applied to cloud/shadow detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. 
- Source codes and experimental illustrations are available at
  - Refined UNet v3: https://github.com/jiaolobel/refined-unet-v3;
  - Refined UNet v4: https://github.com/jiaolobel/refined-unet-v4;
  - Permutohedral Refined UNet: https://github.com/jiaolobel/permutohedral-refined-unet;
  - Efficient Refined UNets: https://github.com/jiaolobel/efficient-refined-unets;
  - Efficient global Perm. Refined UNet (work in progress): https://github.com/jiaolobel/perm-refined-unet-efficient-impls.

Movement classification and visual interpretation for golf swings
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- In this research, we try to illustrate the relations between movement classes and input 1D signals.
- This is applied to the visual interpretation for golf swings.
- Source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/jiaolobel/golf-guided-gradcam.
