Efficient boundary-aware segmentation for high-resolution images
----------------------------------------------------------------
- In this research, we focus on the efficiency and boundary-awareness for objects of interest in high-resolution images. 
- Multiple solutions, built on approximate algorithms, GPU deployment, and multi-thread implementations for CRF inference, have been tried and give rise to significant boundary-awareness and efficiency gain.
- This has been applied to cloud/shadow detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. 
- Source codes and experimental illustrations are publicly available at
  - Refined UNet v3: https://github.com/jiaolobel/refined-unet-v3;
  - Refined UNet v4: https://github.com/jiaolobel/refined-unet-v4;
